# Variety Shoe - JSON Data on a Webpage
This demo shows how a JSON data structure (in this case a shoe collection) can be parsed and rendered on a webpage using Javascript. By keeping the data separate from the display logic, we can achieve a clear separation of concerns.

# JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a [Data Interchange Format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON).

# Separation of Concerns
The principle of "separation of concerns" is a useful idea in many disciplines. Notably, E.W.Dijkstra has described it as a kind of [intelligent thinking](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html).
