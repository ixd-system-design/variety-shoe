# Variety Shoe
This Replit demonstrates how a JSON data structure (in this case a shoe collection) can be parsed and rendered on a webpage using Javascript. By keeping the data separate from the display logic, we can achieve a clear [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). 

# JSON
The `shoes.json` file holds our shoe collection in JSON format. To understand how this works, review the [JSON Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) on Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). See also: [json.org](https://json.org)

# Javascript
We can use Javascript to parse the JSON data and then render it dynamically as HTML. This involves interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM), for example, by [selecting elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector), [creating new elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) or [changing an element's CSS classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList). 

# Learning Prompts
Fork this Replit, and adapt it for your own use. Iterate by following the [Use-Modify-Create approach](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOj7ik70=/?share_link_id=156131850669). 

- Can you modify the names, descriptions, and colours of the shoes?

- How can you extend the CSS and styling to make the shoe collection more engaging?

- Can you integrate web fonts to adjust the 

- Can you add new field to the shoes (e.g. price) and have it appear in the template?

- Upload an image for each shoe to the "Files" area in replit; then reference the images in your JSON so that they appear in the template.

- Tip: To understand the impact of certain lines of code, try commenting them out, to see if anything disappears. 

- **Challenge**: can you create your own JSON data structure (e.g. a collection of your current Sheridan courses) and display it visually on a webpage?
